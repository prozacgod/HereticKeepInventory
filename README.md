Just something simple I whipped up to change up vanilla Heretic a tiny bit.

Uses the DECORATE lump, in a zip file - so zdoom/gzdoom compatible I think

This just creates derivative classes for all built in artifacts that can be collected into inventory.  This seemed to be the only way to get it to work.

All Items are kept (including flight) and you can keep a large quantity of items (up to a really big number)

just add the keepinv.pk3 included, or you can pack the DECORATE file into a zip yourself.
